This is the third year C++ Programming coursework at the University of Surrey. The objective is to design a C++-based interpretable capable of translating BASIC programming language with supports for the following syntax:
- Operators: +, - , *, /, =, <, >, ==
- Let, If... Else, Print, Goto, Input

This code is written in modern C++-14 standard with appropriate error handling.

./<interpreter-program> <BASIC-program-text>
```
